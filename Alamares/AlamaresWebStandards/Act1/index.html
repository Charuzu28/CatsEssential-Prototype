        <p id="about">“Favoritism” is one of the songs to come out of the album to have been penned <br> as a dedication to vocalist Roberto Seña’s girlfriend at the time, Chelo Bacarro.

            <br>According to a tweet by Seña, it is also an ode to a past sound that he liked doing.</p>

        <p><strong>Favoritism Lyrics</strong></p>
        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>A narcissistic-cynic's life
            Entails a grieving heart despite <br>
            The smiles in pictures fade away
            A lonely boy, a pretty face <br>
            I might have dreamed of you and me <br>
            But serial monogamy can take its toll <br>
            It's not a test
            I swear to God, I tried my best</p>
                    <h3>[Refrain]</h3>
                    <p>But then you (What she said, what she said, what she said) <br>
                        Yeah, you (What she said, what she said)</p>
                                <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
                                <p>"You are my favorite boy, " said by my favorite girl <br>
                                    You always do what you want <br>
                                    One little blink and you're gone <br>
                                    If anyone in the world knew you were my favorite girl <br>
                                    I'd rather burn in the sun <br>
                                    One little blink and I'm gone</p>
                                            <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
                                            <p>While I was sitting unaware
                                                Behind the walls I built, I stare <br>
                                                It's nice to know how far we've come <br>
                                                At least with you, I know we're done <br>
                                                You may have dreamed of you and me <br>
                                                But you're too much, it's plain to see <br>
                                                I am a soul you might detest <br>
                                                I swear to God, you'll try your best</p>

                                                        <p>But then you (What she said, what she said, what she said) <br>
                                                            Yeah, you (What she said, what she said)</p>
